                In my free time I try to upskill myself. 
                These are some of the projects I'll be working on during summer.

                With <em>Danishcript</em>, I've been trying to mix JavaScript and my Danish lessons. <br><br>

                With the <em>To-Do-List For Parents</em>, I've been practicing loops within loops. 
                Basically you write something you would like to accomplish that day and boom, your child
                surprises you with something else. <br><br>

                With World Cards, I'm building the first marketplace to buy unique moments from
                different World Cups to own them as digital assets. <br><br>
                
                Finally, my last project spins around the story of Akio Sakurai, 
                the greatest and most thorough imitator of Jimmy Page, the legendary guitar player from Led Zeppelin.
                I'm building a website that tells his story inside of a guitar you can even play by clicking the strings.
