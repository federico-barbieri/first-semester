            <p class="this-project">
                This project taught me how important building wireframes is.
            </p>
        
            <p class="replicate">
                Because I wanted to replicate 100% the real Microsoft Interfase,
                wireframes were my best friends.
            </p>

            <p class="responsive">
                Even though making this website responsive was not a requirement,
                my initial idea was to visually adjust the computer according to the screen
                the user was using.
            </p>

            <p class="means">
                That means you would see a mobile phone if you were using a phone, an ipad 
                if you were using an ipad, and so on. This would have also allowed me to show
                the progress of technology through time. 
            </p>

            <p class="win">
                My biggest personal win was to create a function that imitated the clock
                in the computer. Seeing it work was pure satisfaction.
            </p>
