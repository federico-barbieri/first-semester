                Coming from Argentina, it's no easy task to establish yourself somewhere new. <br><br>
                For that reason, I'm always working towards a purpose, a brighter future
                where everything I'm doing now pays off. <br><br>
                
                Over the past six months I learned as much
                as I could at KEA. <br><br> I'm truly grateful for your teachings and 
                I hope you enjoy this website as much as I enjoyed building it. <br><br>

                My ultimate goal is not only to become a frontend developer, 
                but to be really good at it. <br><br>

                This first semester has been a great first step towards that, 
                and I'm already looking forward to the next one.
